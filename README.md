#### ABOUT THE PLUGIN

This plugin is designed to automatically provide all Counter-Terrorist (CT) players with a defuse kit. The reason for its creation is that the current version of the "retake" game mode by VALVE, which focuses on simulating scenarios where CTs have to retake a bomb site and defuse an already planted bomb, is not fully completed. In this mode, there can be situations where CT players do not have a defuse kit, significantly hindering their ability to defuse the bomb and consequently decreasing their chances of winning the round. Therefore, this plugin ensures that every CT player has a defuse kit from the start of the round or once the bomb is planted, enhancing the fairness and playability of this game mode.<br>
